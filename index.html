<p>Man's Best Friend is an app designed to make taking care of your dog easier while at the same time improving their overall quality of life. This app allows users to enter basic information of their dog, and based on their breed will be given general healthcare suggestions and reminders associated with the dog's well-being. Man's Best Friend will also have a social feature. This feature is great for communicating with your local dog community about variety of subjects (from adoption to opinions on local services available for dog owners).</p>
