<p>Joey is a senior computer science major at the University of Alabama. He comes from Keller, Texas which is a suburb of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. Due to his exceptional grades in high school, Joey received a full tuition scholarship to the University of Alabama in 2012. Never having coded anything in his life, he decided to major in computer science and fell in love with it immediately. Though there have been many challenges along the way, Joey has excelled at UA and will begin working with AT&amp;T in San Francisco, CA after he graduates.</p>

<p>His hobbies include watching movies and television, playing video games, and going on hikes. Joey's family has own two dogs and two cats throughout his lifetime. He is aware of the level of attention they require and how difficult taking care of you dog can really be. That is his motivation for creating Man's Best Friend, so that he can make his, his family's, and every dog owner's life simpler and more convenient.</p>
